# SICHO Freelance Product Page
A "product page" intended to promote my personal freelance company.

Check out the live site [here](https://msichterman.github.io/sicho-freelance/)!

## Motivation
I created this site as one of my responsive web design projects in the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. I wanted to create something to not only satisfy the projects requirements, but also serve as a possible site that I could use in the future.
